				Louisville is an up and coming bike-friendly city. With new bike lanes and scenic parkways designed by one of the premiere park designers in American history, Frederick Olmsted, group riding is one the best ways to achieve your athletic and fitness goals, while meeting new friends and stopping along the way to enjoy the food and beverages the city has to offer. All rides begin at one of Olmsted's masterpieces, Iroquois Park, but feel free to join the ride as it moves.

          Our primary fucntion as a group is to get good people together. Whether you ride daily or are just getting started, we want to engage as many people as possible in a fun and healthy way to experience our great city. While we do ride routes of around 30 miles on a typcial trip, there are riders of all experience levels that travel with us. Part of our rides includes a stop or 2 (depending on the route) at local restaurants and breweries. We certainly have an abundance.
